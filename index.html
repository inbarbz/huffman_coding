    Huffman coding is a <b>lossless</b> data compression algorithm, developed by David A. Huffman and published in his
    paper "A
    Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes” in 1952.

    The idea is to assign variable-length codes to
    input characters. The lengths of the assigned codes are <b> based on the frequencies </b> of corresponding
    characters. The
    most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code.
    <br>
    The variable-length codes assigned to input characters are <b>Prefix Codes</b>, means the codes (bit sequences) are
    assigned in
    such a way that the code assigned to one character is not the prefix of code assigned to any other character. This
    is how Huffman Coding makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream.

        Applications of Huffman Coding:
      </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They are used for transmitting fax and text.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are used by conventional compression formats like PKZIP, GZIP, etc.

        </li>
        <li>
          It is useful in cases where there is a series of frequently occurring characters.

    <b class="application"> As can be seen in the demonstration above:</b> <br>
    <ol>
      <li>
        we place the two <b>least common </b>characters along with their frequency into a <b>binary tree</b>, combining
        them in a new node and adding the individual frequencies of each character together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, we take the next two frequent characters and <b>repeat</b> the process until all characters are combined.

      </li>
      <li>
        We follow each branch until the bottom is reached, <b>assigning 0 for branches on the left and a 1 for those on
          the right</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The result is an <b>optimal and unique bit pattern</b> for each of the characters (as can be seen in the
        brackets). This pattern can be identified following the various paths down the tree.
