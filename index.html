    Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm, developed by David A. Huffman and published in his paper "A
    Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes” in 1952. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to
    input characters. The lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The
    most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code.The
    variable-length codes assigned to input characters are Prefix Codes, means the codes (bit sequences) are assigned in
    such a way that the code assigned to one character is not the prefix of code assigned to any other character. This
    is how Huffman Coding makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream.

      Applications of Huffman Coding:
      </b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They are used for transmitting fax and text.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are used by conventional compression formats like PKZIP, GZIP, etc.

        </li>
        <li>
           It is useful in cases where there is a series of frequently occurring characters.

        </li>
                </ul>
